## This is how it works
If we send a text file as an input text to the app like this:
![Input Text](https://github.com/codewithnine/SelfTranslate/blob/master/Screen%20Shot%202020-02-21%20at%2012.16.56%20AM.png)
---
Here is what we can get as a report:
![Input Text](https://github.com/codewithnine/SelfTranslate/blob/master/Screen%20Shot%202020-02-21%20at%2012.18.22%20AM.png)

This is how it would look in a database:
